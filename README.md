# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-Autoencoders-in-Keras
 Project on Image Super Resolution using Autoencoders in Keras. In this project,I have used  autoencoder and Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to train my autoencoder, and use this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, our neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.
 Steps to be followed to build the model:
1)Project Overview and Import Libraries
2)What are Autoencoders?
3)Build the Encoder
4)Build the Decoder to Complete the Network
5)Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine
6)Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model
7)Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
